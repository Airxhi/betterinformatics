Sometimes audio doesn't always work on DICE. Here's a tutorial to get it working:

1. Plug in audio to regular audio jack (not speaker+mic jack)
   
   The output device must be plugged in!
1. Open sound settings (Settings -> Sound)
   
   The settings pane can be opened up by running `gnome-control-center` from the command line.
1. At the bottom of the pane, change input mode to "duplex". If "duplex" is unavailable, try one of the options.
1. At the top of the pane, make sure the volume is full, and the volume is not muted.
1. Audio should now be working for you.
