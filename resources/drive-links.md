title: Sharing Drive Links
---

When you share a link (see types of links below), only people who are added to the Better Informatics Team Drive have access.

| Type    | Example URL                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Folders | [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/**0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA)                                             |
|   Files | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/**1W1xVJs_RvV3KBbk1bKjsDvYUyUitER4jVbuae-nUFx8**/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1xVJs_RvV3KBbk1bKjsDvYUyUitER4jVbuae-nUFx8/edit) |

If you share one of the above links directly, users without access will be presented with the below interface:

**This is bad!** There is an automated system to add users to the Team Drive.

You can just click the "files" button at the top, and this will just prompt you to log in and associate your
Informatics DICE account (to prove you're an inf student) with a Google account (to use Google Drive).

**If you would like to directly send a link to someone in a group chat**... copy the bolded bit in the URLs above and paste
it in the section indicated below by `ID_HERE`:


```
https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=ID_HERE
```

For example, the following URL `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA` would
produce `https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA`.
